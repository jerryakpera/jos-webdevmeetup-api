      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        My name is Jeremiah Akpera and I say thank you for officially becoming a pioneer member of the Jos WebDev Meetup. While still recognizing that this is the debut event I must also get ahead of myself and say I believe that many more will follow. 
      </p>

      
      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0"> Why? </h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        Over my years in Jos I have bumped into & rubbed minds with less than 5 developers in total. What usually follows is a bout of questions and answers. We try to share ideas, problems and solutions but just in passing, because we all have somewhere to be. Although few and far between, these meetings have always pointed me or refocussed me in the right direction. 
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        So the why would be because there is an untapped human resource when it comes to programmers, software developers and web enthusiasts in Jos. Whether youre looking for a friend, mentor or partner this is an event to facilitate that union.
      </p>

      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0"> What? </h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        The Jos WebDev Meetup simply put, is 3 hours on the 10th of December, 2022 where beginners, developers, architects, project managers, and web enthusiasts can meet, play and learn in a relaxed environment.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        I am not an expert in meetups but if I were going to one I would want it to be three things; welcoming, fun and educative. Welcoming means me being heard and respected does not depend on my skill, but my effort and application. Fun means interesting and lively and educative means hearing from others who know things I do not.
      </p>

      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0">The Agenda</h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        I am fortunate to already have two guest speakers for the first WebDev meetup. They are willing and eager to share their knowledge with you. Including myself that would total three 15 minutes talks + 5 minutes of questions sections;

        The open mic session is a vacant time where people can; 
        <ol>
          <li> 
            ask questions unrelated to the talks but concerning web development
          </li>

            share or propose projects
          </li>

          <li> 
            offer proffesional and/or technical advice. 
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
      It is not a developer bootcamp but we will try to cater for all level of developers. I am not an expert myself but we would make sure to cover topics that range through the different expertice and experience levels as well as through the range of technologies we all employ. 
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        There are two vacant slots for the open-mic so far so I am inviting you to reach out to me if you have something to say during this chapter so I can slot you in.
      </p>

      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0">Logistics</h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        If you can offer any sort of service or help to make this meetup run more smoothly I would greatly appreciate. Here is a list of all the logisitics that must be catered for that day;

        <ol>
          <li>
            Wifi
          </li>
          <li>
            Projector
          </li>
          <li>
            Extension Cables
          </li>
          <li>
            Coffee and water
          </li>
          <li>
            Snacks/food
          </li>
          <li>
            Photography - photo & video editting
          </li>
          <li>
            Note taking / capturing
          </li>
          <li>
            USB Sticks
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        By Gods grace I would find a way to make everything listed above happen, to the best of my ability, but if you are driven to assist in any way please reach out so we can talk. Assistance does not have to be monetary in fact I would prefer the offering of skills or to take notes, volunteering to bring a camera, coffee, flash drives, etc, but I wouldnt say no to contributions. 
        Few must sacrifice for many to benefit and I am looking to form a team to plan future meetups. You dont require any particular skills just the ability to work well in a team.
      </p>

      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0"> Transportation & location </h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        The meetup will take place at UTC Shopping Complex, No 10 lugard road, Jos, Plateau at 10:30AM.
        There should be ample free parking space outside. The size of the hall will limit the attendees to just 20 people. If we can hit this number I would consider it a great success and an indicator that we need to acquire a bigger space for the next Meetup

      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0"> Resources </h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        I would be adding a File sharing feature on the Jos WebDev Meetup site for the sharing of resources on the talks given during the Meetup. Those that have registered and verified their email addresses will then be able to access this feature.

      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
        I would be adding a feedback feature on the web dev meetup where those with verified accounts can provide feedback on Meetups they have attended.
