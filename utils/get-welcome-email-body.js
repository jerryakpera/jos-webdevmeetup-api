      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0"> What? </h4>
      <p style="margin-top: 5px">
      The Jos WebDev Con simply put, is roughly 3 hours on the 10th of December, 2022 where beginners, developers, architects, project managers, and web enthusiasts can meet, network and learn in a relaxed environment. It is an opportunity to share problems your facing at work with real life people. Talk about projects that your working on or ideas that you are developing. 

      <br />
      You will have the chance to discuss new technologies, design patters and solutions in the industry and how you can apply them in your work. It is not a developer boot camp but we will try to cater to all levels of developers. We would make sure to cover topics that range through different expertise, tech, and experience levels.
